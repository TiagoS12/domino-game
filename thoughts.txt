SSE response->

board:
    count:
        user2: 7
        wvict: 7
        __proto__: Object
    line: []
    stock: 14
    __proto__: Object
    turn: "user2"

After that, each user while making a play needs to make a http call with the argument notify with the following body:

{ "nick": "wvict", "pass": "test", "game": "2fd9dâ€¦", "piece": "[6,6]" } 

At least I found a way to make the userTiles variable global.

LOGIC:
0) Make sure both users registered and made the join call.
1) If username is equal to the user in the turn object, then make http request (notify).
2) If not, return error message.
